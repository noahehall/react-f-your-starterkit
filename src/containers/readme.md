## Containers

Everyone has their own interpretation & implementation, but ours is:
  - a container aggregates several modules into a feature, or functionality, that is comprised of multiple components, or is included in routing
  - a component is a single feature or functionality,
  - either can stateful or stateless

Boom, simple (and still dynamic enough to be agile).

## Other things
  - Only containers can be included as a route
